  fullDescription: >-
    G'norman is a curious gnome. Answer his whimsical ponderings, and he’ll sculpt what you say into a beautiful garden.
    Make sure to check on your garden (and G’norman) often before those pesky weeds (or beautiful wildflowers, whichever
    your POV) take over! 


    When it's all full, keep the zen garden by your side as you go about your activities, or delight in a new one if you
    fancy a daily change of scenery.
